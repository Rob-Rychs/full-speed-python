This book aims to teach the Python programming language using a practical approach. Its method is quite simple: after a short introduction to each topic, the reader is invited to learn more by solving the proposed exercises.

These exercises have been used extensively in my web development and distributed computing classes at the Superior School of Technology of Set√∫bal. With these exercises, most students are up to speed with Python in less than a month. In fact, students of the distributed computing course, taught in the second year of the software engineering degree, become familiar with Python's syntax in two weeks and are able to implement a distributed client-server application with sockets in the third week.

The source of this book is available on github (https://github.com/joaoventura/full-speed-python). I welcome any pull requests to correct misspellings, suggest new exercises or to provide clarification of the current content.


## Building

Run `make pdf` or `make epub` to build the books.

This project uses [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to build the books. The pdf file is built with pdflatex, so you may need to download a latex distribution.
